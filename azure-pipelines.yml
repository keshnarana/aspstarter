# Azure Pipelines YAML documentation
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema

# this file defines a set of jobs that will run when triggered on a cloned version of your repo.
# a job is a set of steps
# by default, ther'es just one job, and you give it its list of steps

# by default, all branches get built
# but adding a trigger configuration like this says "only build master branch"
trigger:
- master

# a pool is a set of machines for running this job.
# this configuration says: "use Microsoft's hosted Ubuntu Linux virtual machines"
# (we could, if we wanted, have it connect to a machine WE control to run the job on)
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# the steps in the job
# "script" is one kind of step - on linux it'll run in bash
# on windows it'll run in command prompt
# give all steps a good display name
steps:

 - script: echo Hello, world!
   displayName: Print hello world

 - script: |
     echo "Showing current directory contents"
     ls
   displayName: Show directory contents
